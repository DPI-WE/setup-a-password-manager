# Setup a Password Manager üîê
In this lesson, you will learn how to set up and manage a password manager. Password managers are essential tools for maintaining strong cybersecurity practices and protecting your digital life. This lesson will emphasize the importance of using a password manager, provide tips on creating strong passwords, and guide you through setting up your own password manager.

## Why Password Managers are Important
Passwords are the key to almost everything you do online, and you probably have multiple passwords that you use throughout the day. Choosing hard-to-hack passwords and managing them securely can sometimes seem inconvenient. Fortunately, there are simple ways to make your passwords as secure as possible. Doing so can keep hackers from taking over your accounts and prevent the theft of your information or money from online banking.

## Password Best Practices
These tips will help make your digital life more secure:

1. **Never reveal your passwords to others**. Your login credentials protect information as valuable as the money in your bank account. Nobody needs to know them but you‚Äînot even the IT department. If someone is asking for your password, it‚Äôs likely a scam.

2. **Use different passwords for different accounts**. That way, if one account is compromised, the others won‚Äôt be at risk.

3. **Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)**. MFA adds another layer of protection in addition to your username and password. Generally, the additional factor is a token or a mobile phone app that you use to confirm your identity. Learn more about MFA and how to turn it on for many popular websites at twofactorauth.org.

4. **Length trumps complexity**. The longer a password is, the better. Use at least 16 characters whenever possible.

5. **Make passwords that are hard to guess but easy to remember**. Use sentences or phrases. For example, ‚Äúbreadandbutteryum‚Äù. Some systems even let you use spaces: ‚Äúbread and butter yum‚Äù. Many password managers have password generators to make this easy.

6. **Avoid single words or a word preceded or followed by a single number (e.g., Password1)**. Hackers use dictionaries of words and commonly used passwords to guess your password.

7. **Don‚Äôt use information in your password that others might know about you or that‚Äôs in your social media**. Avoid using birthdays, children‚Äôs or pet‚Äôs names, car models, etc. If your friends can find it, so will hackers.

8. **Complexity still counts**. To increase complexity, include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. A password should use at least three of these choices. For example: ‚ÄúBread & butter YUM!‚Äù

## Using a Password Manager
Password management tools, or password vaults, are great ways to organize your passwords. They store your passwords securely, and many provide a way to back-up your passwords and synchronize them across multiple systems. Here are some examples of free password managers:

- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
- [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/)
- [Password Safe](https://pwsafe.org/)
- [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)

Please sign up for a password manager and install it on your devices. I personally use Bitwarden, which is free for personal use and syncs across desktop and mobile devices. There are many out there, so do your research and choose the one that best fits your needs.
